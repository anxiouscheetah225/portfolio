        <p class="intro">
            I have many passions, and I like to keep track of how much time I dedicate to each of them. Hourly simply combines time-tracking functionality
            with a to-do list interface for topic-related tasks. It also has a feature in which you can add time to selected areas of activity. Hourly holds me
            accountable to my commitments while also giving me a sense of affirmation for the work I've already done. Basically, I wanted to make something Malcolm Gladwell
            would appreciate.
