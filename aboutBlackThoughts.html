        <p class="intro">
            Black Thoughts is the bare beginnings of my dream project, combining my doctoral research with my developing skills in Computer Science to
            create an interface that makes exploring intellectual discourse more interesting and fun. The site essentially treats different academic papers as
            nodes which are linked together based on whether they share a common related author. Modeling knowledge as a 3D graph makes it easier to show how 
            different authors and works are connected, and might even lead to cross-disciplinary collaborations which otherwise wouldn't be thought of. My ultimate goal is
            to expand this page into a social media site that privileges longform content and makes academic forms of knowledge more accessible.

                <ul>
                    <li>Use RegEx to validate/sanitize Submitted Data</li>
                    <li>Use WebGL to make the graph more aesthetically interesting</li>

        <p class="note">
            In the very long term, I want to explore the fact that graphs, as a composite of vertices and edges, can function simultaneously as a data-structure for information
            and as the raw material for graphical objects, like meshes. This could lead to interesting ways to interface knowledge as a matter of form and content. For example,
            if there's a cluster of connected vertices that all have to do with, say, fashion history, I would want the cluster to organize itself in the shape of a
            dress. This way, users could get a sense of what a group of edges is about before clicking on it.
